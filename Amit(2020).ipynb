        "The issue is that “causality” itself is a nebulous concept. From Aristotle to Hume and Kant, many philosophers and scholars have attempted to define causality but have not reached a consensus so far.\n",
        "\n",
        "（举个例子说明为什么定义因果是很难的事情）To understand the difficulty, let us first ask you, the reader, to let go of this book and drop it on the floor—and then pick it up again and continue reading! Now, let us ask, what was the cause of the book dropping? Did the book fall because you let go of the book? Or did the book fall because we, the authors, asked you, the reader, to drop it? Perhaps you would have let go of the book even if we had not asked you to. Maybe it was gravity. Perhaps the book fell because the reader is not an astronaut reading the book in space.\n",
        "\n",
        "This simple example of the falling book illustrates many of the important, philosophical challenges that have vexed philosophers’ efforts to conceptualize causality. These include basic concepts of abstractions, as well as sufficient and necessary causes. E.g., gravity is of course necessary, but not sufficient, to cause the book to fall—gravity together with the reader letting go of the book is both necessary and sufficient for the book to fall. This example also illustrates both proximate and ultimate causes. E.g., the reader dropping the book is a proximate cause, the authors asking the reader to drop the book may be a more distant, ultimate cause. Finally, this example raises the question of whether causes must be deterministic. In other words, does the likelihood that not all (or even most) readers are suggestible enough to drop this book when asked imply that the authors’ request is not a cause at all? Or is it possible for our request to be considered a probabilistic cause?\n",

        "Hume asks how we know—how we learn—what causes an event? Consider the simple act of striking a match and observing that it lights up. Would we say that striking causes the match to light up? Believing in data, say we repeat this action 1000 times and observe the same outcome each time. Hume argues that, while this may seem to provide strong evidence that striking the match causes it to light, this specific experiment only demonstrates predictability, and argues that these results are indistinguishable from the case where the two events just happen to be perfectly correlated with each other. Hume proposed this quandary in his book, “A Treaties of Human Nature”, in 1738, and concludes that **causality must be a mental construct that we assign to the world**, and thus does not exist outside it. Other scholars challenge this provocation and argue for the existence of causality."

Modern advances in causal reasoning have not come through answering most of these provocations directly but, rather, by creating flexible methods for reasoning about the relationships between causes and effects regardless of the abstractions one chooses. In this book, therefore, we attempt to steer clear of the above philosophical ambiguities and adopt one of the more simple and practical approaches to causal reasoning, known as **the interventionist definition of causality.**"
